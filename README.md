## Prostate cancer prediction model
This is the dataset of 100 patients to implement the machine learning algorithm and thereby interpreting results

The data set consists of 100 observations and 10 variables (out of which 8 numeric variables and one categorical variable and is ID) which are as follows:
1. Id
2. Radius
3. Texture
4. Perimeter
5. Area
6. Smoothness
7. Compactness
8. diagnosis_result
9. Symmetry
10. Fractal dimension
